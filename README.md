Features
Quiz Session: The user can start a quiz session and be presented with random multiple-choice questions.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or above
Django 3.2 or above
Groq 0.13.0 for the ai integration

Assumptions
Category Selection: The user first selects a category from the available quiz categories. The categories are predefined in the database and represent different topics or types of quizzes available to the user.

Quiz Duration: Once a category is selected, the user is presented with 10 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) randomly selected from that category. Each question will have four options (A, B, C, D), and the user can choose one option as their answer.

Answer Submission: After the user selects an answer, they can submit it. The system will check if the answer is correct or incorrect, and this is stored in the database for future reference.

AI Explanation for Incorrect Answers: If the user answers a question incorrectly, they will have the option to request an AI-generated explanation. This explanation provides insights into why the selected answer is incorrect and what the correct answer should be, based on the reasoning of the AI.

Results: At the end of the quiz, the user is shown the total number of questions they answered, along with the breakdown of correct and incorrect answers. For each incorrect answer, the AI explanation will be provided to help the user understand the mistake.

Technologies Used
Django: Framework for the backend.
Groq API: For generating AI-powered explanations.
SQLite: For storing categories, questions, and answers in the database.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For the frontend design.
